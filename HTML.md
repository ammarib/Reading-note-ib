# HTML 
* HTML pages are text documents.
 * HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
*  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# Process & Design

 ## Who is the Site For?
 
  Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
  site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

##  Why People Visit YOUR Website ?

 Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve? 

 It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.
  
  ## What Information Your Visitors Need ?
  
 You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

## How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site ?

  Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) 
  may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.
  
  ## Site Maps !
  
   Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
   
 ## WireFrames !
   
    A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a
    site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
    
 ## Getting your message across using design 
       The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
        information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

## Visual hierarchy 

  Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
  information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets 
  across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
  
## grouping and Similarity

  When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a 
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

## Designing Navigation
 Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
 helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
 Good navigation tends to follow these principles...
