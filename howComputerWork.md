# What is the Computer ?
A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words,
an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it,
chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input,
storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

# HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK?
A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components.
A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions 
it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device. 
How does this come together to make the computer work?

The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we
will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data
has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, 
takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an
output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.
## the steps so computer would give an  output
* Input:
Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of
getting information into your computer that it can process. If you use a microphone
and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.
* Memory/storage:
Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a
hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. But smaller, computer-based devices like digital
cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards.
* Processing: Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit)
is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly hot in the process. 
That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating!
* Output: Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution 
(very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output.
