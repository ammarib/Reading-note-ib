# JavaScript
Can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

## What's the Script

* A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a
script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.

## Every step for every task shown
in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can
understand and follow.
In this book, we are focussing on the JavaScript
language and how it is used in web browsers.
Just like learning any new language, you need
to get to grips with the:
* Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand
* Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow

# EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions

- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE

# OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
